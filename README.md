This is the main area now where i shall post some minor and all major changes from now on,
so that you dont feel that i have gone dead or something.

rest of the readme is filled with the curseforge desc, so dont bother to read it

This Pack was originally meant for exploration of various dimensions,
like the twilight forest, planets in different solar systems, and much more,
but will soon be overhauling most of the processes like ore purification to obtain various metals,
exploring various planets to gather many more resources, such as Iridium, Dilithium, etc.
New Machines for Energy production, such as Fission Reactors, Molten Salt Reactors,
and new, custom structures to be looted, such as the TechGun ships, pirate ships, military bases, miner bases and much more.

Note that some of the features mentioned below are from the library file, i.e, NuclearTechReborn Lib-v0.1 only for v0.1-1.12.2,
and for the future versions there will be no such library file required to download and set up to play.

Features:

 

A Decay Pool Multiblock with 22 recipes (More coming soon) Which can produce Preheated Water that in turn can be used to produce steam,


A liquid Combustion Energy Generator that has recipes that allow you to Burn Up liquids to generate tons of RF and some slag (Byproduct) which can be used to produce various other stuff like concrete, etc.

 

The Catalytic Chemical reactor which speeds up chemical reactions with the help of a catalyst,

 

New Planets, dimensions, solar systems by Advanced Rocketry (and more custom made planets coming soon),

 

Nukes, Radioactive wastelands, Fission Reactors, Molten salt reactors, Radioactive isotopes of elements, Spent Fuel Processing Methods and much more by Nuclearcraft,
